#ViewConstructor#
* A project is one of exercises realized during WebDeveloper course. 
* It has to show more or less a light copy of a program close to 'jsbin.com'.
* This program allows to write and run a code that you want to see in a next pannel.
* It's a nice place to check HTML or CSS features.
